# Backup Script

This is a **local backup program** I personally use to keep a copy of my important files. I synchronize my cloud drive (e.g., Google Drive, KDrive) **with the backup folder**, rather than my working directory, to avoid the drive **accidentally modifying or deleting files** in my projects. Cloud drives often try to sync everything continuously, including temporary or compilation files, which can mess up your working files ‚Äî this script ensures your original files remain safe while the backup folder stays up to date.

The script performs an **incremental backup** of your documents using `rsync`. It excludes certain folders and files (`.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, and LaTeX temporary files) and creates a **timestamped log** for each backup. You can also launch it via a **desktop shortcut with a popup confirmation**.

## üöÄ Usage

Once installed, you don‚Äôt need to run the script manually from the terminal. Simply **open your applications menu** and search for:

```text
Backup Documents
```

Clicking it will:

1. Show a popup asking if you want to start the backup.
2. If confirmed, it synchronizes your working directory (e.g., `~/Documents`) to `~/backups` incrementally.
3. Excluded files and folders (`.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, LaTeX temporary files) are skipped.
4. A log file `backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log` is created in `~/backups`.
5. Another popup shows whether the backup succeeded or failed.

## üì• Installation

Install the backup system using the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
```

This will:

-   Create the necessary directories:

    -   `~/.local/bin` ‚Üí for the scripts
    -   `~/.local/share/icons` ‚Üí for the desktop icon
    -   `~/.local/share/applications` ‚Üí for the `.desktop` launcher

-   Copy the scripts:

    -   `popup_backup.sh` ‚Üí `~/.local/bin/`
    -   `backup.sh` ‚Üí `~/.local/bin/`

-   Make the scripts executable

-   Create a `.desktop` launcher with an absolute path to the script and icon

-   Copy the icon `backup.png` to `~/.local/share/icons/`

You can then launch the backup from your applications menu.

## ‚è∞ Automating Daily Backups

You can configure the script to run **automatically every day at 20:00** using `cron`. Add this line to your crontab:

```bash
0 20 * * * DISPLAY=:0 ~/.local/bin/popup_backup.sh
```

This will:

-   Show the popup at 20:00 each day
-   Run the backup only if you confirm
-   Ensure that your backup folder is always up to date
-   Prevent accidental file modifications in your working directories due to cloud drive sync

## üßπ Uninstallation

To remove all installed files:

make clean
```

This will remove:
